## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: MHARD Dataset
- **Total Reviews**: 200,972
- **Apps Covered**: 30+ mental health and wellness apps
- **Rating Distribution**:
  - Low (1-2⭐): 43,505 reviews (21.6%)
  - Mid (3⭐): 11,111 reviews (5.5%)
  - High (4-5⭐): 146,356 reviews (72.8%)

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### **Data Preprocessing**
```python
# Text preprocessing with lemmatization
- Lowercase conversion
- Remove special characters
- Lemmatization (helps → help, helped → help)
- Remove stop words
```

#### **Rating Group Classification**
```python
df['rating_group'] = pd.cut(df['rating'],
                             bins=[0, 2, 3, 5],
                             labels=['Low (1-2⭐)', 'Mid (3⭐)', 'High (4-5⭐)'])
```

### 2. Keyword Extraction

**TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
- Extracts meaningful keywords from each rating group
- Filters common words (app, just, like, really, etc.)
- Identifies distinctive features for each rating tier

```python
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
    max_features=200,
    stop_words=custom_stopwords,
    ngram_range=(1, 2),  # unigrams and bigrams
    min_df=2,
    max_df=0.9
)
```

### 3. Negation Analysis

Analyzes how keywords are used with negation to understand true sentiment:
- "doesn't help" vs "really helps"
- "not worth it" vs "worth every penny"

### 4. Pain Points Categorization

Reviews categorized into 6 pain point categories:
1. 💰 Monetization Issues
2. 🐛 Technical Issues
3. 🔐 Account/Access Issues
4. 📱 Device/Platform Issues
5. 😤 UX/Usability Issues
6. 📢 Ads Issues

### 5. Success Factors Identification

Features categorized by importance (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM):
- 🎯 Core Features
- 🧘 Mental Health Features
- 📊 Analytics & Insights
- 💡 Ease of Use
- 🎨 Design & UI
- 🆓 Free Features
- 🔔 Reminders & Notifications
- 🔒 Privacy & Security

🌈 Custom themes & personalization
☁️  Cloud sync across devices
📤 Export data (PDF/CSV)
🎯 Goal setting & tracking
🧠 AI-powered insights & recommendations
```

### ⚠️ AVOID at All Costs

```
❌ Forcing subscription too early

## 💡 Key Takeaways

### 1. **Simplicity Wins**
Users consistently praise apps that are "easy to use," "simple," and "intuitive." Complex features should be optional, not default.

### 2. **Free Core, Paid Premium**
Successful apps provide essential mood tracking and journaling for free, reserving advanced analytics and customization for premium users.

### 3. **Reliability is Non-Negotiable**
Technical issues (crashes, bugs, data loss) are the #2 complaint. Invest heavily in quality assurance.

### 4. **Mental Health Focus**
Features addressing anxiety, stress, and meditation are the most valued. This is the core value proposition.

### 5. **Transparent Monetization**
Be upfront about costs. Users hate surprises. A fair, transparent pricing model builds trust.

### 6. **Privacy Matters**
While only 1% explicitly mention it, privacy-conscious users are vocal advocates. Make privacy a feature.

### Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn wordcloud scikit-learn nltk
```

### Running the Analysis

#### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)

```bash
cd review-scraping/src
jupyter notebook review_analysis_eda.ipynb
```

**What it does:**
- Loads and preprocesses 200K+ reviews
- Performs text preprocessing with lemmatization
- Extracts keywords using TF-IDF
- Generates word clouds by rating group
- Creates visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps)
- Analyzes negation patterns

#### 2. Reflecta Insights Extraction (Python Script)

```bash
cd review-scraping/src
python reflecta_insights_analysis.py
```

**What it does:**
- Categorizes pain points (6 categories)
- Identifies success factors (8 categories)
- Analyzes monetization strategy risks
- Compares top-rated apps
- Generates actionable recommendations
- Saves results to JSON

### Code Highlights

#### Text Preprocessing with Lemmatization

```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

def preprocess_text(text):
    """Clean and lemmatize text"""
    text = str(text).lower()
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-z\s]', ' ', text)
    
    words = text.split()
    lemmatized_words = []
    for word in words:
        lemma = lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos='v')
        if lemma == word:
            lemma = lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos='n')
        lemmatized_words.append(lemma)
    
    return ' '.join(lemmatized_words).strip()
```

**Why lemmatization?**
- "helps", "helped", "helping" → "help" (single keyword)
- Reduces noise and improves keyword extraction
- Better semantic understanding

#### TF-IDF Keyword Extraction

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

def extract_keywords_tfidf(text_series, top_n=30):
    """Extract top keywords using TF-IDF"""
    documents = text_series.fillna('').astype(str).tolist()
    documents = [doc for doc in documents if doc.strip()]
    
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
        max_features=200,
        stop_words=custom_stopwords,
        ngram_range=(1, 2),
        min_df=2,
        max_df=0.9
    )
    
    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)
    feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
    scores = tfidf_matrix.sum(axis=0).A1
    
    top_indices = scores.argsort()[-top_n:][::-1]
    keywords = {feature_names[i]: scores[i] for i in top_indices}
    
    return keywords
```

**Why TF-IDF?**
- Identifies distinctive keywords for each rating group
- Filters out common words automatically
- Captures bigrams (e.g., "mood tracking", "data loss")

#### Negation Analysis

```python
def analyze_keyword_with_negation(keyword, text_series):
    """Detect negation patterns around keywords"""
    negation_patterns = [
        r'\b(not|no|never)\s+\w*\s*' + keyword,
        r'\b(don\'t|doesn\'t|didn\'t|won\'t|can\'t)\s+\w*\s*' + keyword,
    ]
    
    positive_count = 0
    negative_count = 0
    
    for text in text_series:
        if keyword in str(text).lower():
            is_negated = any(re.search(p, text) for p in negation_patterns)
            if is_negated:
                negative_count += 1
            else:
                positive_count += 1
    
    return {
        'positive': positive_count,
        'negative': negative_count,
        'negative_ratio': negative_count / (positive_count + negative_count)
    }
```

**Why negation analysis?**
- "doesn't help" vs "helps a lot" have opposite meanings
- Understanding context prevents misinterpretation
- Low ratings may use positive words negatively

## 📊 Visualizations

### Word Clouds by Rating Group

The analysis generates word clouds showing the most frequent terms in each rating category:

- **Low Ratings**: Dominated by "pay", "subscription", "charge", "bug", "crash"
- **Mid Ratings**: Mix of positive and negative terms
- **High Ratings**: "love", "helpful", "amazing", "easy", "anxiety", "track"

### TF-IDF Bar Charts

Horizontal bar charts display the top 15 keywords for each rating group, ranked by TF-IDF score.

### Keyword Comparison Heatmap

Shows how keywords are distributed across different rating levels (1-5 stars).
